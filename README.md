2.	Side Bar: Adjacent to the Activity Bar, it shows context-specific views and tools, such as the file explorer, search results, and source control information.
3.	Editor Group: The main area where you open and edit files. It supports multiple tabs and split views for side-by-side file editing.
4.	Status Bar: Located at the bottom, it displays information about the current file, such as line number, encoding, and errors. It also shows the current Git branch and other relevant status indicators

4. Command Palette:
   - What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.
The Command Palette in VS Code is a powerful tool that provides quick access to various commands and features within the editor. It can be accessed by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac). This opens a searchable menu where you can type and execute commands without navigating through menus.
Examples of Common Tasks:
Open Settings-Type Preferences: Open Settings to adjust user or workspace settings.
Install Extensions-Type Extensions: Install Extensions to add new functionality to your editor.
Toggle Terminal-Type Terminal: Toggle Integrated Terminal to open or close the integrated terminal.
Format Document:
o	Type Format Document to automatically format the currently open file.
Git Commands-Type Git: Commit to commit changes or Git: Pull to pull the latest changes from a repository.

5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.
Extensions in VS Code enhance its functionality, enabling users to tailor their development environment to specific needs. They can add language support, debuggers, linters, themes, and other tools to improve productivity.
Finding and Installing Extensions
Access Extensions View:Click the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar 
Search and Install: Use the search bar to find extensions. Click Install on desired extensions.
Managing Extensions: Manage installed extensions from the Extensions view, where you can disable, enable, or uninstall them.
Essential Extensions for Web Development:
1.	ESLint:-Lint JavaScript and TypeScript code to maintain code quality.
2.	Prettier: -Automatically format code for consistency.
3.	Live Server-Launch a local development server with live reload for static and dynamic pages.
4.	Debugger for Chrome: -Debug JavaScript code in the Chrome browser.
5.	HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Snippets-Provide code snippets for faster development

6. Integrated Terminal:
   - Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code. What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?
To open the integrated terminal in VS Code, follow these steps:
1.	Open Terminal:
o	Click View in the top menu, then select Terminal, or use the shortcut Ctrl+`` (Windows
2.	Using the Terminal:
o	The terminal opens at the bottom of the window. You can run shell commands, execute scripts, and manage files directly within the editor. Use the + icon to open multiple terminal instances.
Advantages of the Integrated Terminal:
Convenience-The terminal is embedded within VS Code, allowing seamless switching between coding and command-line tasks without leaving the editor.
Workspace Context-The integrated terminal opens in the context of your current workspace, making it easier to run project-specific commands.
Synchronization: -Environment variables and path configurations are consistent with the VS Code environment.
Customization-The terminal inherits VS Code's themes and settings, providing a unified and personalized development environment.

7. File and Folder Management:
   - Explain how to create, open, and manage files and folders in VS Code. How can users navigate between different files and directories efficiently?
Creating-To create a new file, click File > New File or press Ctrl+N (Windows/.
For a new folder, right-click in the Explorer sidebar and select New Folder.
Opening:Open existing files via File > Open File or press Ctrl+O (Windows/ Open a folder with File > Open Folder.
